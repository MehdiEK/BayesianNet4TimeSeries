# Added value of bayesian networks for time series

The objective of this project is to explore the benefits and added value that Bayesian networks can bring to time series data. 

To achieve this, we propose implementing a dynamic Bayesian network using the PgmPy library. We aim to test this implementation on simulated data, energy consumption data, and financial data.


## TO DO / Next steps:

1. Complete the implementation of a user-friendly Bayesian network.
2. Implement a straightforward test.
3. Test a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) on energy consumption data.
4. Test the DBN on financial data.
5. Compare the results with other methods.
